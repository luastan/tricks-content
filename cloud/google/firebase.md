## Tips

- When creating an account on a service using Firebase; monitor the account attributes and if possible the account info on firestore. Maybe there's some attribute like `finished_setup` that allows you to execute privileged actions that are typically run during the account set-up to create admin accounts or something along the lines
  - This should also apply to similar services like Cognito.
