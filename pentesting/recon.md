#### Usefull Options

The following is a list with the most usefull options for nmap **ordered by likelyhood of use**, starting from the most important to those featured in the CEH but serve pretty much no purpose on a day to day basis:

- **Scan techniques**:
  1. `-sS`: TCP SYN - _Stealthy_ and **quick** scan.
  2. `-sT`: TCP Connect() - TCP scan that completes connection. Will give more info than the `-sS` option.
  3. `-sU`: UDP Scan - Performs a scan through UDP.
- **Port options**:
  1. `-p`: Only scan specified ports. Examples:
     - `-p22`
     - `-p1-65535`
     - `-p-`
     - `-p U:53,111,137,T:21-25,80,139,8080,S:9`
  2. `-F`: Scan **F**ewer ports than the default scan.
- **Detections**:
  - `-O`: OS detection
  - `-sV`: Service/Version info
- **Host discovery**:
- **Output options**
  - `-oA`: Output in (Normal, xml and s|<rIpt kIddi3)
  - `-oG`: Output in Grepable format
  - `-oN`: Output in Normal format
  - `-oX`: Output in XML
- **Speed options**
  - `T`<0-5>: Set the timing template (higher is faster).
- **Misc**:
  1. `-A`: Enable **A**ll - OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute
