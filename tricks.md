This is just a documentation test, using Nuxt Content. It is generated from vanilla markdown and has support for vue components.

## Global variables
One of the main features I wanted to build is the possibility of defining global variables. Â¿What are those? Go on some of the pages that have content on them and try changing the `collaborator` and `target-domain` variables:

 - [OAuth 2.0](/web/2-advanced/oauth)
 - [XXE injection](/web/1-server-side/xxe#exploitation)
 - [Google API keys](/cloud/google/api-keys)

The variables are updated across the whole documentation and saved on your browser's localStorage. 

This results very useful when trying a subset of payloads or snippets against a target.
